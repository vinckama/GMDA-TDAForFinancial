# GMDA-TDAForFinancial

## Project
The goal of this project was to analyze the evolution of daily returns of four 
major US stock markets indices(DowJones, Nasdaq, Russell2000, SP500) over the 
period 1987 2016 using persistent homology following the approach proposed by 
M. Gidea and Y. Katz in [1].

This project is part of the Foundations of Geometric Methods in Data Analysis course at CentraleSupélec. It is a fairly free project in the form that we have a few questions to guide us around a research paper [1]. This course is given by Frederic Cazals and Frederic Chazal, research director, Inria.


we have developed a Command line 
interface under Python allowing to reproduce the results of our approach.

## Installation
The whole module is based on the Gudhi library [2]. 
The graphics are displayed using matplotlib [3].
Since Gudhi is not located in the pip, 
we advise you to use Anaconda.

To install the requirements, you can execute the following command:
```bash
conda install --file='requirements.txt' -y
```

We also advise you to create a new environment:
```bash
conda create --name='GMDA-env' -y
conda activate GMDA-env
```

## Command Line Interface

### Demo
You can run the demo script to get a 
preview of the contents of the package.
```bash
chmod +x ./demo.sh
./demo.sh
```

You can locate the environment using the command
```bash
conda env list 
```

### Documentation
`Note your python interpreter linked to anaconda "pyconda".
You can find it by locating your environment. 
The interpreter is usually found in the bin/python folder`

The general idea of the command is to use the "manage.py" file.
```bash
pyconda manage.py <\command>
```
At the first launch, the program will download the datasets from the internet. 

`This documentation is not meant to be exhaustive, however, 
it gives a good idea of the contents of the package. You 
find details on the command arguments using the '-h' argument that you can associate with any
 what an command.`
#### Dataset
Access to the dataset
```bash
pyconda manage.py dataset <\subcommand>
```
| subcommand     | explaination            | arguments   |
| :----------:   | :----------:             | :----------: |
|  visualise     | visualise the dataset   | --log <br/> --save    |

#### Landscape
Access to the landscape persistence
```bash
pyconda manage.py landscape <\subcommand>
```
| subcommand     | explaination            | arguments   |
| :----------:   | :----------:             | :----------: |
|  visualise     | plot the landscape graphs  | -w_size <br/> --end_date <br/> --save    |
|  get     | get the persistence tree and the landscape   | -w_size <br/> --end_date    |
|  clean     | clean the hidden working database   |  |

#### Norm
Access to the norm L1 & L2 of the persistence
```bash
pyconda manage.py norm <\subcommand>
```
| subcommand     | explaination            | arguments   |
| :----------:   | :----------:             | :----------: |
|  visualise     | plot the norm graph  | -w_size <br/> --start_date <br/> --end_date <br/> --save    |
|  get     | get the norm   | -w_size <br/> --start_date <br/> --end_date  |
|  crash_stats     |  get and plot statistics on crashs   | -w_size <br/> -year <br/> --test <br/> --plot </br> save  |
|  clean     | clean the hidden working database   |  |


#### Bottleneck
Access to the bottleneck of the persistence
```bash
pyconda manage.py bottleneck <\subcommand>
```
| subcommand     | explaination            | arguments   |
| :----------:   | :----------:             | :----------: |
|  visualise     | plot the bottleneck graph  | -w_size <br/> --start_date <br/> --end_date <br/> --save    |
|  get     | get the bottleneck   | -w_size <br/> --start_date <br/> --end_date  |
|  crash_stats     |  get and plot statistics on crashs   | -w_size <br/> -year <br/> --test <br/> --plot </br> save  |
|  clean     | clean the hidden working database   |  |
